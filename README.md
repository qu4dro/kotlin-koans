## Introduction

### Hello World!

```
Check out the function syntax and change the code to make the function start 
return the string "OK".
```

Solution

```kotlin
fun start(): String = "OK" 
```

### Named arguments

```
Make the function joinOptions() return the list in a JSON format (e.g., "[a, b, c]") 
by specifying only two arguments.

Default and named arguments help to minimize the number of overloads and improve the 
readability of the function invocation. The library function joinToString is declared 
with default values for parameters:

fun joinToString(
    separator: String = ", ",
    prefix: String = "",
    postfix: String = "",
    /* ... */
): String

It can be called on a collection of Strings.
```

Solution

```kotlin
fun joinOptions(options: Collection<String>) =
    options.joinToString(", ", "[", "]")
```

### Default arguments

```
Imagine, you have several overloads of 'foo()' in Java:

public String foo(String name, int number, boolean toUpperCase) {
    return (toUpperCase ? name.toUpperCase() : name) + number;
}
public String foo(String name, int number) {
    return foo(name, number, false);
}
public String foo(String name, boolean toUpperCase) {
    return foo(name, 42, toUpperCase);
}
public String foo(String name) {
    return foo(name, 42);
}

You can replace all these Java overloads with one function in Kotlin. Change 
the declaration of the foo function in a way that makes the code using foo 
compile. Use default and named arguments.
```

Solution

```kotlin
fun foo(name: String, number: Int = 42, toUpperCase: Boolean = false) =
    (if (toUpperCase) name.toUpperCase() else name) + number

fun useFoo() = listOf(
    foo("a"),
    foo("b", number = 1),
    foo("c", toUpperCase = true),
    foo(name = "d", number = 2, toUpperCase = true)
)
```

### Triple-quoted strings

```
Learn about the different string literals and string templates in Kotlin.

You can use the handy library functions trimIndent and trimMargin to format 
multiline triple-quoted strings in accordance with the surrounding code.

Replace the trimIndent call with the trimMargin call taking # as the prefix 
value, so that the resulting string doesn't contain the prefix character.
```

Solution

```kotlin
const val question = "life, the universe, and everything"
const val answer = 42

val tripleQuotedString = """
    #question = "$question"
    #answer = $answer""".trimMargin("#")

fun main() {
    println(tripleQuotedString)
}
```

### String templates

```
Triple-quoted strings are not only useful for multiline strings, but also 
for creating regex patterns as you don't need to escape a backslash with a 
backslash.

The following pattern matches a date in the format 13.06.1992 (two digits, 
a dot, two digits, a dot, four digits):

fun getPattern() = """\d{2}\.\d{2}\.\d{4}"""
Using the month variable rewrite this pattern in such a way that it matches 
the date in the format 13 JUN 1992 (two digits, a whitespace, a month 
abbreviation, a whitespace, four digits).
```

Solution

```kotlin
val month = "(JAN|FEB|MAR|APR|MAY|JUN|JUL|AUG|SEP|OCT|NOV|DEC)"

fun getPattern(): String = """\d{2}\ $month \d{4}"""
```

### Nullable types

```
Learn about null safety and safe calls in Kotlin and rewrite the following 
Java code so that it only has one if expression:

public void sendMessageToClient(
    @Nullable Client client,
    @Nullable String message,
    @NotNull Mailer mailer
) {
    if (client == null || message == null) return;

    PersonalInfo personalInfo = client.getPersonalInfo();
    if (personalInfo == null) return;

    String email = personalInfo.getEmail();
    if (email == null) return;

    mailer.sendMessage(email, message);
}
```

Solution

```kotlin
fun sendMessageToClient(
    client: Client?, message: String?, mailer: Mailer
) {
    val personalInfo: PersonalInfo? = client?.personalInfo
    val email: String? = personalInfo?.email
    if (email != null && message != null) {
        mailer.sendMessage(email, message)
    }
}

class Client(val personalInfo: PersonalInfo?)
class PersonalInfo(val email: String?)
interface Mailer {
    fun sendMessage(email: String, message: String)
}
```

### Nothing types

```
Nothing type can be used as a return type for a function that always 
throws an exception. When you call such a function, the compiler uses 
the information that it throws an exception.

Specify Nothing return type for the failWithWrongAge function. Note 
that without the Nothing type the checkAge function doesn't compile 
because the compiler assumes the age can be null.
```

Solution

```kotlin
import java.lang.IllegalArgumentException

fun failWithWrongAge(age: Int?): Nothing {
    throw IllegalArgumentException("Wrong age: $age")
}

fun checkAge(age: Int?) {
    if (age == null || age !in 0..150) failWithWrongAge(age)
    println("Congrats! Next year you'll be ${age + 1}.")
}

fun main() {
    checkAge(10)
}
```

### Lambdas

```
Kotlin supports functional programming. Learn about lambdas in Kotlin.

Pass a lambda to the any function to check if the collection contains 
an even number. The any function gets a predicate as an argument and 
returns true if there is at least one element satisfying the predicate.
```

Solution

```kotlin
fun containsEven(collection: Collection<Int>): Boolean =
    collection.any { it % 2 == 0 }
```

## Classes

### Data classes

```
Learn about classes, properties and data classes and then rewrite the 
following Java code to Kotlin:

public class Person {
    private final String name;
    private final int age;

    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }
}
Afterwards add the data modifier to the resulting class. This will make 
the compiler generate a few useful methods for this class: equals/hashCode, 
toString and some others.
```

Solution

```kotlin
data class Person(val name: String, val age: Int)

fun getPeople(): List<Person> {
    return listOf(Person("Alice", 29), Person("Bob", 31))
}

fun comparePeople(): Boolean {
    val p1 = Person("Alice", 29)
    val p2 = Person("Alice", 29)
    return p1 == p2  // should be true
}
```

### Smart casts

```
Rewrite the following Java code using smart casts and the when expression:

public int eval(Expr expr) {
    if (expr instanceof Num) {
        return ((Num) expr).getValue();
    }
    if (expr instanceof Sum) {
        Sum sum = (Sum) expr;
        return eval(sum.getLeft()) + eval(sum.getRight());
    }
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown expression");
}
```

Solution

```kotlin
fun eval(expr: Expr): Int =
    when (expr) {
        is Num -> expr.value
        is Sum -> eval(expr.left) + eval(expr.right)
        else -> throw IllegalArgumentException("Unknown expression")
    }

interface Expr
class Num(val value: Int) : Expr
class Sum(val left: Expr, val right: Expr) : Expr
```

### Sealed classes

```
Reuse your solution from the previous task, but replace the interface 
with the sealed class. Then you no longer need the else branch in when.
```

Solution

```kotlin
fun eval(expr: Expr): Int =
    when (expr) {
        is Num -> expr.value
        is Sum -> eval(expr.left) + eval(expr.right)
    }

sealed class Expr
data class Num(val value: Int) : Expr()
data class Sum(val left: Expr, val right: Expr) : Expr()
```

### Rename on import

```
When you import a class or a function, you can specify a different 
name to use for it by adding as NewName after the import directive. 
This can be useful if you want to use two classes or functions with 
similar names from different libraries.

Uncomment the code and make it compile. Rename Random from the kotlin 
package to KRandom, and Random from the java package to JRandom.
```

Solution

```kotlin
import kotlin.random.Random as KRandom
import java.util.Random as JRandom

fun useDifferentRandomClasses(): String {
    return "Kotlin random: " +
            KRandom.nextInt(2) +
            " Java random:" +
            JRandom().nextInt(2) +
            "."
}
```

### Extension functions

```
Learn about extension functions. Then implement the extension functions 
Int.r() and Pair.r() and make them convert Int and Pair to a RationalNumber.

Pair is a class defined in the standard library:

data class Pair(
    val first: A,
    val second: B
)
```

Solution

```kotlin
fun Int.r(): RationalNumber = RationalNumber(this, 1)

fun Pair<Int, Int>.r(): RationalNumber = RationalNumber(this.first, this.second)

data class RationalNumber(val numerator: Int, val denominator: Int)
```

## Conventions

### Comparison

```
Learn about operator overloading and how the different conventions for 
operations like ==, <, + work in Kotlin. Add the function compareTo to 
the class MyDate to make it comparable. 
After this the code below date1 < date2 should start to compile.

Note that when you override a member in Kotlin, the override modifier is mandatory.
```

Solution

```kotlin
data class MyDate(val year: Int, val month: Int, val dayOfMonth: Int) : Comparable<MyDate> {
    override operator fun compareTo(other: MyDate): Int {
        if (this.year > other.year || this.month > other.year || this.dayOfMonth > other.dayOfMonth) return 1
        return if (this.year < other.year || this.month < other.year || this.dayOfMonth < other.dayOfMonth) -1
        else 0
    }
}

fun test(date1: MyDate, date2: MyDate) {
    // this code should compile:
    println(date1 < date2)
}
```

### Ranges

```
Using ranges implement a function that checks whether the date is in 
the range between the first date and the last date (inclusive).

You can build a range of any comparable elements. In Kotlin in checks 
are translated to the corresponding contains calls and .. to rangeTo calls:

val list = listOf("a", "b")
"a" in list  // list.contains("a")
"a" !in list // !list.contains("a")

date1..date2 // date1.rangeTo(date2)
```

Solution

```kotlin
fun checkInRange(date: MyDate, first: MyDate, last: MyDate): Boolean {
    return date in first..last
}
```

### For loop

```
A Kotlin for loop can iterate through any object if the corresponding 
iterator member or extension function is available.

Make the class DateRange implement Iterable, so that it can be iterated 
over. Use the function MyDate.followingDate() defined in DateUtil.kt; 
you don't have to implement the logic for finding the following date on your own.

Use an object expression which plays the same role in Kotlin as an anonymous class in Java.
```

Solution

```kotlin
class DateRange(val start: MyDate, val end: MyDate) : Iterable<MyDate> {
    override fun iterator(): Iterator<MyDate> {
        return object : Iterator<MyDate> {
            var current: MyDate = start

            override fun next(): MyDate {
                if (!hasNext()) throw NoSuchElementException()
                val next = current
                current = current.followingDate()
                return next
            }

            override fun hasNext(): Boolean = current <= end
        }
    }
}

fun iterateOverDateRange(firstDate: MyDate, secondDate: MyDate, handler: (MyDate) -> Unit) {
    for (date in firstDate..secondDate) {
        handler(date)
    }
}
```

### Operators overloading

```
Implement date arithmetic. Support adding years, weeks, and days to a date. 
You could write the code like this: date + YEAR * 2 + WEEK * 3 + DAY * 15.

First, add the extension function plus() to MyDate, taking the TimeInterval 
as an argument. Use the utility function MyDate.addTimeIntervals() declared 
in DateUtil.kt

Then, try to support adding several time intervals to a date. You may need 
an extra class.
```

Solution

```kotlin
import TimeInterval.*

data class MyDate(val year: Int, val month: Int, val dayOfMonth: Int)

// Supported intervals that might be added to dates:
enum class TimeInterval { DAY, WEEK, YEAR }

operator fun MyDate.plus(timeInterval: TimeInterval): MyDate = addTimeIntervals(timeInterval, 1)

fun task1(today: MyDate): MyDate {
    return addTimeIntervals(today, 1, 1)
}

fun task2(today: MyDate): MyDate {
    return addTimeIntervals(today, 2, 3, 5)
}

fun addTimeIntervals(myDate: MyDate, year: Int = 0, week: Int = 0, day: Int = 0): MyDate {
    return myDate
        .addTimeIntervals(YEAR, year)
        .addTimeIntervals(WEEK, week)
        .addTimeIntervals(DAY, day)
}
```

### Invoke

```
Objects with an invoke() method can be invoked as a function.

You can add an invoke extension for any class, but it's better 
not to overuse it:

fun Int.invoke() { println(this) }

1() //huh?..
Implement the function Invokable.invoke() so it can count the 
number of times it is invoked.
```

Solution

```kotlin
class Invokable {
    var numberOfInvocations: Int = 0
        private set

    operator fun invoke(): Invokable {
        numberOfInvocations++
        return this
    }
}

fun invokeTwice(invokable: Invokable) = invokable()()
```

## Collections

### Introduction

```
This section was inspired by GS Collections Kata.

Kotlin can be easily mixed with Java code. Default collections 
in Kotlin are all Java collections under the hood. Learn about 
read-only and mutable views on Java collections.

The Kotlin standard library contains lots of extension functions 
that make working with collections more convenient. For example, 
operations that transform a collection into another one, starting 
with 'to': toSet or toList.

Implement the extension function Shop.getSetOfCustomers(). The class 
Shop and all related classes can be found in Shop.kt.
```

Solution

```kotlin
fun Shop.getSetOfCustomers(): Set<Customer> =
    this.customers.toSet()
```

### Sort

```
Learn about collection ordering and the the difference between 
operations in-place on mutable collections and operations returning 
new collections.

Implement a function for returning the list of customers, sorted in 
descending order by the number of orders they have made. Use 
sortedDescending or sortedByDescending.

val strings = listOf("bbb", "a", "cc")
strings.sorted() ==
        listOf("a", "bbb", "cc")

strings.sortedBy { it.length } ==
        listOf("a", "cc", "bbb")

strings.sortedDescending() ==
        listOf("cc", "bbb", "a")

strings.sortedByDescending { it.length } ==
        listOf("bbb", "cc", "a")
```

Solution

```kotlin
// Return a list of customers, sorted in the descending by number of orders they have made
fun Shop.getCustomersSortedByOrders(): List<Customer> =
    this.customers.toList().sortedByDescending { it.orders.size }
```

### Filter map

```
Learn about mapping and filtering a collection.

Implement the following extension functions using the 
map and filter functions:

Find all the different cities the customers are from.
Find the customers living in a given city.

val numbers = listOf(1, -1, 2)
numbers.filter { it > 0 } == listOf(1, 2)
numbers.map { it * it } == listOf(1, 1, 4)
```

Solution

```kotlin
// Find all the different cities the customers are from
fun Shop.getCustomerCities(): Set<City> =
    this.customers.toList().map { it.city }.toSet()

// Find the customers living in a given city
fun Shop.getCustomersFrom(city: City): List<Customer> =
    this.customers.toList().filter { it.city == city }
```

### All Any and other predicates

```
Learn about testing predicates and retrieving elements by condition.

Implement the following functions using all, any, count, find:

checkAllCustomersAreFrom should return true if all customers are from a given city
hasCustomerFrom should check if there is at least one customer from a given city
countCustomersFrom should return the number of customers from a given city
findCustomerFrom should return a customer who lives in a given city, or null if 
there is none

val numbers = listOf(-1, 0, 2)
val isZero: (Int) -> Boolean = { it == 0 }
numbers.any(isZero) == true
numbers.all(isZero) == false
numbers.count(isZero) == 1
numbers.find { it > 0 } == 2
```

Solution

```kotlin
// Return true if all customers are from a given city
fun Shop.checkAllCustomersAreFrom(city: City): Boolean =
    this.customers.all { it.city == city }

// Return true if there is at least one customer from a given city
fun Shop.hasCustomerFrom(city: City): Boolean =
    this.customers.any { it.city == city }

// Return the number of customers from a given city
fun Shop.countCustomersFrom(city: City): Int =
    this.customers.count { it.city == city }

// Return a customer who lives in a given city, or null if there is none
fun Shop.findCustomerFrom(city: City): Customer? =
    this.customers.find { it.city == city }
```

### Max min

```
Learn about Collection Aggregate Operations.

Implement two functions:

the first should return the customer who has placed 
the most amount of orders in this shop the second 
should return the most expensive product 
that has been ordered by the given customer
The functions max, min, maxBy, and minBy might be helpful.

listOf(1, 42, 4).max() == 42
listOf("a", "ab").minBy(String::length) == "a"
You can use callable references instead of lambdas. This can be especially helpful in call chains, where it occurs in different lambdas and has different types. Implement the getMostExpensiveProductBy function using callable references.
```

Solution

```kotlin
// Return a customer who has placed the maximum amount of orders
fun Shop.getCustomerWithMaxOrders(): Customer? =
    customers.maxBy { it.orders.size }

// Return the most expensive product that has been ordered by the given customer
fun getMostExpensiveProductBy(customer: Customer): Product? =
    customer.orders.flatMap { it.products }.maxBy { it.price }
```

### Sum

```
Implement a function that calculates the total amount of 
money the customer has spent: the sum of the prices for 
all the products ordered by a given customer. Note that 
each product should be counted as many times as it was ordered.

Use sum or sumBy. If you want to sum up double values, use sumByDouble.

listOf(1, 5, 3).sum() == 9
listOf("a", "b", "cc").sumBy { it.length } == 4
```

Solution

```kotlin
// Return the sum of prices for all the products ordered by a given customer
fun moneySpentBy(customer: Customer): Double =
    customer.orders.flatMap { it.products }.sumByDouble { it.price }
```

### GroupBy

```
Learn about grouping. Use groupBy to implement the function to build 
a map that stores the customers living in a given city.

val result = 
    listOf("a", "b", "ba", "ccc", "ad")
        .groupBy { it.length }

result == mapOf(
    1 to listOf("a", "b"),
    2 to listOf("ba", "ad"),
    3 to listOf("ccc"))
```

Solution

```kotlin
// Build a map that stores the customers living in a given city
fun Shop.groupCustomersByCity(): Map<City, List<Customer>> =
    customers.groupBy { it.city }
```

### Associate

```
Learn about association. Implement the following functions
 using associateBy, associateWith, and associate:

Build a map from the customer name to the customer
Build a map from the customer to their city
Build a map from the customer name to their city
val list = listOf("abc", "cdef")

list.associateBy { it.first() } == 
        mapOf('a' to "abc", 'c' to "cdef")

list.associateWith { it.length } == 
        mapOf("abc" to 3, "cdef" to 4)

list.associate { it.first() to it.length } == 
        mapOf('a' to 3, 'c' to 4)
```

Solution

```kotlin
// Build a map from the customer name to the customer
fun Shop.nameToCustomerMap(): Map<String, Customer> =
    customers.associateBy { it.name }

// Build a map from the customer to their city
fun Shop.customerToCityMap(): Map<Customer, City> =
    customers.associateWith { it.city }

// Build a map from the customer name to their city
fun Shop.customerNameToCityMap(): Map<String, City> =
    customers.associate { it.name to it.city }
```

### Partition

```
Learn about partitioning and the destructuring declaration 
syntax that is often used together with partition.

Then implement a function for returning customers who have 
more undelivered orders than delivered orders using partition.

val numbers = listOf(1, 3, -4, 2, -11)
val (positive, negative) =
    numbers.partition { it > 0 }

positive == listOf(1, 3, 2)
negative == listOf(-4, -11)
```

Solution

```kotlin
// Return customers who have more undelivered orders than delivered
fun Shop.getCustomersWithMoreUndeliveredOrders(): Set<Customer> =
    customers.filter { it ->
        val (delivered, undelivered) = it.orders.partition {
            it.isDelivered
        }
        delivered.size < undelivered.size
    }.toSet()
```

### FlatMap

```
Learn about flattening and implement two functions using flatMap:

The first should return all products the given customer has ordered
The second should return all products that were ordered by at least 
one customer

val result = listOf("abc", "12")
    .flatMap { it.toList() }

result == listOf('a', 'b', 'c', '1', '2')
```

Solution

```kotlin
// Return all products the given customer has ordered
fun Customer.getOrderedProducts(): List<Product> =
    orders.flatMap { it.products }

// Return all products that were ordered by at least one customer
fun Shop.getOrderedProducts(): Set<Product> =
    customers.flatMap { it.orders }.flatMap { it.products }.toSet()
```

### Fold

```
Learn about fold and reduce and implement a function that returns 
the set of products that were ordered by all the customers using fold.

You can use the Customer.getOrderedProducts() which was defined in 
the previous task (copy its implementation).

listOf(1, 2, 3, 4)
    .fold(1) { partProduct, element ->
        element * partProduct
    } == 24
```

Solution

```kotlin
// Return the set of products that were ordered by all customers
fun Shop.getProductsOrderedByAll(): Set<Product> {
    val allProducts = customers.flatMap { it.getOrderedProducts() }.toSet()
    return customers.fold(allProducts)
    { orderedByAll, customer -> orderedByAll.intersect(customer.getOrderedProducts()) }
}

fun Customer.getOrderedProducts(): List<Product> =
    orders.flatMap { it.products }
```

### Compound tasks

```
Implement two functions:

The first one should find the most expensive product among all the 
delivered products ordered by the customer. Use Order.isDelivered flag.

The second one should count the amount of times a product was ordered. 
Note that a customer may order the same product several times.

Use the functions from the Kotlin standard library that were previously 
discussed.

You can use the Customer.getOrderedProducts() function defined in the 
previous task (copy its implementation).
```

Solution

```kotlin
// Find the most expensive product among all the delivered products
// ordered by the customer. Use `Order.isDelivered` flag.
fun findMostExpensiveProductBy(customer: Customer): Product? {
    return customer.getOrderedProducts().maxBy { it.price }
}

// Count the amount of times a product was ordered.
// Note that a customer may order the same product several times.
fun Shop.getNumberOfTimesProductWasOrdered(product: Product): Int {
    return customers.flatMap { it.orders }.flatMap { it.products }.count { it == product }
}

fun Customer.getOrderedProducts(): List<Product> =
    orders.filter { it.isDelivered }.flatMap { it.products }
```

### Getting used to new style

```
We can rewrite and simplify the following code using lambdas and operations on collections. Fill in the gaps in doSomethingWithCollection, the simplified version of the doSomethingWithCollectionOldStyle function, so that its behavior stays the same and isn't modified in any way.

fun doSomethingWithCollectionOldStyle(
    collection: Collection
): Collection<String>? {
    val groupsByLength = mutableMapOf<Int, MutableList<String>>()
    for (s in collection) {
        var strings: MutableList<String>? = groupsByLength[s.length]
        if (strings == null) {
            strings = mutableListOf()
            groupsByLength[s.length] = strings
        }
        strings.add(s)
    }

    var maximumSizeOfGroup = 0
    for (group in groupsByLength.values) {
        if (group.size > maximumSizeOfGroup) {
            maximumSizeOfGroup = group.size
        }
    }

    for (group in groupsByLength.values) {
        if (group.size == maximumSizeOfGroup) {
            return group
        }
    }
    return null
}
```

Solution

```kotlin
fun doSomethingWithCollection(collection: Collection<String>): Collection<String>? {

    val groupsByLength = collection.groupBy { s -> s.length }

    val maximumSizeOfGroup = groupsByLength.values.map { group -> group.size }.max()

    return groupsByLength.values.firstOrNull { group -> group.size == maximumSizeOfGroup }
}
```

### Sequences

```
Learn about sequences, they allow you to perform operations lazily rather than eagerly. 
Copy the implementation from the previous task and modify it in a way that the operations 
on sequences are used.
```

Solution

```kotlin
// Find the most expensive product among all the delivered products
// ordered by the customer. Use `Order.isDelivered` flag.
fun findMostExpensiveProductBy(customer: Customer): Product? {
    return customer.getOrderedProducts().maxBy { it.price }
}

// Count the amount of times a product was ordered.
// Note that a customer may order the same product several times.
fun Shop.getNumberOfTimesProductWasOrdered(product: Product): Int {
    return customers.flatMap { it.orders }.flatMap { it.products }.count { it == product }
}

fun Customer.getOrderedProducts(): Sequence<Product> =
    orders.filter { it.isDelivered }.flatMap { it.products }.asSequence()
```

## Properties

### Properties

```
Learn about the properties in Kotlin.

Add a custom setter to PropertyExample.propertyWithCounter so that the counter property
is incremented every time a propertyWithCounter is assigned to it.
```

Solution

```kotlin
class PropertyExample() {
    var counter = 0
    var propertyWithCounter: Int? = null
        set(value) {
            counter++
            field = value
        }
}
```

### Lazy property

```
Add a custom getter to make the val 'lazy' really lazy. It should be 
initialized by invoking 'initializer()' during the first access.

You can add any additional properties as you need.

Do not use delegated properties!
```

Solution

```kotlin
class LazyProperty(val initializer: () -> Int) {
    var lazyValue: Int? = null
        get() {
            if (field == null) field = initializer()
            return field
        }
    val lazy: Int
        get() =
            lazyValue!!
}
```

### Delegates examples

```
Learn about delegated properties and make the property lazy using delegates.
```

Solution

```kotlin
class LazyProperty(val initializer: () -> Int) {
    val lazyValue: Int by lazy(initializer)
}
```

### Delegates how it works

```
You can declare your own delegates. Implement the methods of the class 
EffectiveDate so you can delegate to it. Store only the time in milliseconds 
in the timeInMillis property.

Use the extension functions MyDate.toMillis() and Long.toDate(), defined in MyDate.kt.
```

Solution

```kotlin
import kotlin.properties.ReadWriteProperty
import kotlin.reflect.KProperty

class D {
    var date: MyDate by EffectiveDate()
}

class EffectiveDate<R> : ReadWriteProperty<R, MyDate> {

    var timeInMillis: Long? = null

    override fun getValue(thisRef: R, property: KProperty<*>): MyDate {
        return timeInMillis!!.toDate()
    }

    override fun setValue(thisRef: R, property: KProperty<*>, value: MyDate) {
        timeInMillis = value.toMillis()
    }
}
```

## Builders

### Function literals with receiver

```
Learn about function literals with receiver.

You can declare isEven and isOdd as values, that can be called as extension functions. 
Complete the declarations in the code.
```

Solution

```kotlin
fun task(): List<Boolean> {
    val isEven: Int.() -> Boolean = { this % 2 == 0 }
    val isOdd: Int.() -> Boolean = { this % 2 == 1 }

    return listOf(42.isOdd(), 239.isOdd(), 294823098.isEven())
}
```

### String and map builders

```
Function literals with receiver are very useful for creating builders, for example:

fun buildString(build: StringBuilder.() -> Unit): String {
    val stringBuilder = StringBuilder()
    stringBuilder.build()
    return stringBuilder.toString()
}

val s = buildString {
    this.append("Numbers: ")
    for (i in 1..3) {
        // 'this' can be omitted
        append(i)
    }
}

s == "Numbers: 123"
Implement the function 'buildMap' that takes a parameter (of extension function type) 
creates a new HashMap, builds it, and returns it as a result.
```

Solution

```kotlin
fun buildMap(hash: HashMap<Int, String>.() -> Unit): Map<Int, String> {
    return HashMap<Int, String>().apply { hash() }
}

fun usage(): Map<Int, String> {
    return buildMap {
        put(0, "0")
        for (i in 1..10) {
            put(i, "$i")
        }
    }
}
```

### The function apply

```
The previous examples can be rewritten using the library function 
apply. Write your own implementation of this function named 'myApply'.

Learn about the other scope functions and how to use them.
```

Solution

```kotlin
fun <T> T.myApply(f: T.() -> Unit): T {
    return this.apply { f() }
}

fun createString(): String {
    return StringBuilder().myApply {
        append("Numbers: ")
        for (i in 1..10) {
            append(i)
        }
    }.toString()
}

fun createMap(): Map<Int, String> {
    return hashMapOf<Int, String>().myApply {
        put(0, "0")
        for (i in 1..10) {
            put(i, "$i")
        }
    }
}
```

### Html builders

```
1. Fill the table with proper values from the product list. 
The products are declared in data.kt.

2. Color the table like a chess board. Use the getTitleColor() 
and getCellColor() functions. Pass a color as an argument to the 
functions tr, td.

Run the main function defined in the file demo.kt to see the rendered table.
```

Solution

```kotlin
fun renderProductTable(): String {
    return html {
        table {
            tr (color = getTitleColor()) {
                td {
                    text("Product")
                }
                td {
                    text("Price")
                }
                td {
                    text("Popularity")
                }
            }
            val products = getProducts()
            products.forEachIndexed { i, product ->
                tr (color = getCellColor(i)){
                    td { this.text(product.description) }
                    td { this.text(product.price) }
                    td { this.text(product.popularity) }
                }
            }
        }
    }.toString()
}

fun getTitleColor() = "#b9c9fe"
fun getCellColor(i: Int) = if (i % 2 == 0) "#dce4ff" else "#eff2ff"

```

### Builders how it works

```
Answer the questions below

1. In the Kotlin code

tr {
    td {
        text("Product")
    }
    td {
        text("Popularity")
    }
}
'td' is:

a. a special built-in syntactic construct

b. a function declaration

c. a function invocation

2. In the Kotlin code

tr (color = "yellow") {
    td {
        text("Product")
    }
    td {
        text("Popularity")
    }
}
'color' is:

a. a new variable declaration

b. an argument name

c. an argument value

3. The block

{
    text("Product")
}
from the previous question is:

a. a block inside built-in syntax construction td

b. a function literal (or "lambda")

c. something mysterious

4. For the code

tr (color = "yellow") {
    this.td {
        text("Product")
    }
    td {
        text("Popularity")
    }
}
which of the following is true:

a. this code doesn't compile

b. this refers to an instance of an outer class

c. this refers to a receiver parameter TR of the function literal:

tr (color = "yellow") {
    this@tr.td {
        text("Product")
    }
}
```

Solution

```kotlin
enum class Answer { a, b, c }

val answers = mapOf<Int, Answer?>(
        1 to c, 2 to b, 3 to b, 4 to c
)
```
